I decided to make a design that was minimalistic but easy to use as it allowed for easily discerning elements on the mirror without stopping your from being able to see yourself in the Mirror by keeping the center open and unobstructed<br>

The interactive program on the sketch implements most of the features on the sketch that I choose to fit. The presentation style is using contrast by having a white background and black text for most presented information. This allows ease of use even if the bathroom or otherwise is dim and might make it hard to see if it was just text.The information windows are placed along the left edge it a symmetric pattern where none of them are greater width wise making it easier on the eyes. The information is presented sans-serif Style to allow the user to properly understand and use the information on screen. The time is displayed at the top and larger to give it design precedence as it will spur the user to be wary of the time especially with the calendar to the center left. There is also a light function in the upper right corner that allows for a color that can light the mirror. It is effective at night but will be unobtrusive when another light source is on. It also allows a little variety of colors.<br>
