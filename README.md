Project 2 Mirror interface<br>
The base elevator I used which is filled with multiple faults that make the elevator subpar compared to a more precise design.<br>

<h2>Original design</h1><br>

To begin with is the most obvious issue with buttons A and B being very lacking in description of what they are. To the average person who may not frequently use elevators how are they to know these are basement floors? How are they to know this isn't the original floors which is barely helped by the small star on the floor 1 label?<br>

Then there are the keyholes which take up large amounts of space instead of in their own space away from the buttons making them an obstruction for the average user.<br>
You may also notice the alarm button is immediately below the door open button which makes it a big issue if someones finger were to slip while pushing a button or if a person isn't paying attention which is fairly common. This could cause an unneccessary alarm to occur when the button would be better off placed elsewhere.<br>
While the issues aren't necessarily completely intrusive they are still issues that could be improved on<br>
<br><br>
<h2>Sketch and improvement</h2><br>

My elevator redesign still uses what works with the old design and implements improvements to the design that address the prior issues as well as marking the addition of an interactive touch screen. The reason I keep the regular button panel is to allow for people who prefer the old system, need Braille, or simply wish to not use the touchscreen. This is also a good backup for if there is an electric outage causing the touchpad to short still allowing the alarm buttons to work. The redesign moves the key slots out of the way so they are no longer intrusive as well as moving the alarm buttons so they are accessible still if you are in a wheelchair or possibly a small child riding alone in case of emergency but are now away from the floor buttons to avoid an accidental press. Lastly more Braille was added to ensure blind people can still understand every button. It also properly gives a lable to ground floor A and B<br><br>

<h2>Interface</h1><br>

The interactive program on the sketch touchscreen functions to replicate most elevator functions with the difference being that it includes descriptions of the floors you are going to and what they include. This allows a new user of this elevator to understand the building layout easily and quickly find a part of the building they want with confidence thus saving time that might be spent having to look themselves. It also easily shows the current floor location and keeps track of the elevator progress on a screen thats easier to read than straining your neck up to look or not even knowing its there. This brings the information up close which is good for people with bad vision or the like. Plus this interactive shows floor destination and elevator movement direction for further clarity. However a normal interface will still be readily avaliable if the touchscreen interface is not to taste.<br>
